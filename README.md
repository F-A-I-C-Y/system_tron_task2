## Titanic Dataset Analysis
# Overview
This project performs an analysis of the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about the passengers and predict their survival rates. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning models.

# Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
- Visualization: Using charts and graphs to explore relationships in the dataset.
- Prediction Models: Building and evaluating models to predict survival rates.

# Installation
To run this notebook, ensure the following tools and libraries are installed:
- Python (version X.X)
-  Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.

#Install the dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt  

#Usage

Run the cells step-by-step to follow the analysis.
Dataset
The Titanic dataset is sourced from Kaggle. Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory if required.

Analysis Highlights
Visualized key variables like passenger class, age, and gender.
Explored survival rates across various demographics.
Built machine learning models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, to predict survival.
Results
The notebook achieves a prediction accuracy of XX% using [best model].
